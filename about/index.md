        It was towards the end of the COVID-19 pandemic that SHODAN's quote from "System Shock" came to mind. As a former student turned adjunct faculty, it was disheartening to walk the halls once filled with conversation completely void. Places dedicated to student life consumed by administrative offices and a commons area silent enough that you can hear a paperclip strike the carpet. It was this perspective that prompted the thought that, even without the students, a "perfect" educational institution would manage to persist.

        Toward the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, SHODAN's quote from System Shock came to mind. As a former student turned adjunct faculty member, I found it disheartening to walk through halls once filled with conversation, now empty. Spaces once dedicated to student life had been consumed by administrative offices, and the commons area was so quiet that a falling paperclip could be heard striking the carpet. From this perspective, I began to consider whether an ostensibly "perfect" educational institution might continue to operate - even without students.

      <p>
        This reflection resurfaced as I developed my dissertation topic. I questioned why existing frameworks often rely on "perfect" definitions that are frequently adapted to meet policy or research needs. It was the significant discrepancies in defining rural populations and the reliance on proximity to urban centers as a primary determinant that suggested an opportunity for deeper analysis. This led me to pose a key research question: <em>What if distance from an urban center were removed from the equation?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The resulting dissertation sought to mathematically model rural and urban populations using socio-ethnic variables rather than geographic distance. My objective was to avoid Waldorf's (2006) "threshold trap" while leveraging established classification systems such as the National Center for Education Statistics' locale framework and the U.S. Census Bureau's Census Block data. Unexpectedly, the model revealed"“pocket communities" within every locale where rural conditions and behaviors manifested regardless of official designation.</p>

          <em>The context should not be what is rural and what
  is urban; it appears this is not the correct question as the rural condition does not map into
  geographic areas delineated in existing data sources. Instead, any future inquiry should be into
  the barriers that prevent places needing aid from receiving it.</em>

        Following a brief hiatus, I have chosen to expand the scope of this research to encompass the entire continental United States, analyzing each state individually. The goal of this phase is to develop a series of peer-reviewed scholarly articles suitable for publication in academic journals. The modeling and geospatial analysis processes are computationally intensive; the original dissertation required approximately 60 hours of geospatial processing across four Mac Minis, supplemented by $2,000 in AWS credits. Variable selection from 918 fields required 13 hours, and the subsequent modeling process an additional 34 hours.

        This website serves both as a platform to share ongoing research developments and as a call for scholarly collaboration and institutional support. Opportunities for partnership may include research funding, hardware resources, data sharing, or academic appointments at universities and technical colleges. Each contribution, large or small, plays a meaningful role in advancing this work.
