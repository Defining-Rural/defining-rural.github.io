      <h4>Policy Development</h4>
      <p>
        Definitions of rural and urban shape public policies, creating legislative action that
lessens impediments, builds prospects, or offers other motivations influencing policymaking
decisions (Childs et al., 2022; Nanzer, 2004). In the United States, the development of many existing policies and programs is to support rural places and bridge the economic gap between them and urban places (Mueller et al., 2020).

      <h4>Policy Effectiveness</h4>
      <p>
        Classifications of rural used by the Federal government justify the planning, application, and monitoring of
policy interventions and development efforts to meet the needs of a population, creating an
exacerbation of resource issues when different agencies fund communities with departments pecific definitions (Cloke & Edwards, 1986).

      <h4>Health & Education</h4>
      <p>
        The growing health, education, and infrastructure disparities between rural and urban
areas are due to the lax standard for spatially structuring places (Bishop & Cushing, 2008; Childs
et al., 2022). Using any of the most frequently cited Federal definitions and
characteristics of rurality, the percentage of the population classified as rural can vary from 17 to
49% (Cromartie & Bucholtz, 2008).

      <h4>Dynamic Boundaries</h4>
      <p>
        Administrative, land-use, and economic concepts of populations are the basis of Federal definitions but no longer accurately represent a place's well-being (Florida, 2009; Cromartie & Bucholtz, 2008). Policymakers frequently update
definitions to capture the changing essence of place by measuring and mapping population
thresholds to determine an area’s political boundaries and resources (Abler, 1992; Mueller et al.,
2020; Blaschke et al., 2018). Because definitions do not incorporate experiential data that can be
collected and interpreted confidently (Taun, 1977).

      </div>
      <h4>Concealing Heterogeneity</h4>
      <p>
        Many Federal agencies and legislative codes conceal heterogeneity, lacking sensitivity to
local variations in rural sites, by dichotomizing urban and rural classifications (Jenkins et al.,
2016). The conventional spatial binary classification methods used to distinguish rural places are
insufficient, making it impossible to study a well-defined population as these methods do not
account for the variation of population density within large areas (Childs et al., 2022).
